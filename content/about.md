<h2>Hi,</h2>

<p>
I'm Debanwita, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate currently working as a Design Engineer at 
<a href="https://www.headout.com">Headout</a>.
</p>

<p>
At Headout, I work at the intersection of design and engineering — building and owning the design system, shipping UI revamps across web and app, and enabling fast-paced product experiments using Framer. 
I’ve led festive theming and animation setups across multiple surfaces, built SEO-focused microbrand templates, and helped standardize components and iconography across codebases. 
Previously, I worked on accessibility, internal tooling, CMS migrations, and animation setups.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, my work interests lean towards design systems, frontend architecture, animation tooling, and building developer/design infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
Alongside that, I still explore Machine Learning (primarily, Deep Learning). Last followed 
<a href="https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106184">this wonderful course</a> and the 
<a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">mandatory ebook</a>.
I also dabble in <a href="https://openprocessing.org/class/1640/">generative code</a> (math pretty).
</p>

<p>
I read (and sometimes write) fiction, predominantly fantasy and sci-fi, listen to rock music and inhale Netflix for survival. 
I'm currently reading 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/184156364-the-little-sparrow-murders">The Little Sparrow Murders</a> by Seishi Yokomizo and 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208430658-blood-over-bright-haven">Blood Over Bright Haven</a> by M.L. Wang. 
I used to be an avid quizzer and debater back in school (something I've been meaning to pick back up) and might randomly spew a ton of junk thanks to it. Also, I paint :D
